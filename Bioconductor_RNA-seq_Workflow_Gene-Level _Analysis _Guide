## Package Review: RNA-seq Workflow - Gene-Level Exploratory Analysis and Differential Expression  

**Author:** Michael Love [aut, cre]  
**Maintainer:** Michael Love <michaelisaiahlove at gmail.com>  

This package offers a comprehensive workflow for gene-level RNA-seq differential expression analysis.
It begins with raw FASTQ files and includes functionalities such as alignment to a reference genome, 
generation of a count matrix, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for quality assessment.  
This package is particularly well-suited for users new to RNA-seq analysis, as it provides step-by-step 
guidance through differential gene expression analysis and visualization of results. It serves as a 
complete end-to-end analysis pipeline, making it an excellent resource for researchers.  

### Highlights:  
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Available on all platforms.  
- **High ranking:** Ranked 3 out of 30 in its category.  
- **Rigorous testing:** Passed all tests across different operating systems.  
- **Dependencies:** Requires 208 dependencies to function.
